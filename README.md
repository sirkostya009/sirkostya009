## Wassup, my name is Constantine

#### A tech freak. A funny fella. A Java, Go dev.

I'm currently working on/studying:
- Golang, love the lingo, it's got its own downsides but overall a refreshing experience from Java.
- [REDACTED]-store, basically an online solution for a [REDACTED] shop. Currently private.

My pride and joy:
- [ai-cheats](https://github.com/sirkostya009/ai-cheats) a way to cheat on my uni's online tests. Currently abandoned because OpenAI models are rather stupid and expensive (nah I'm just broke).
- [lissajouse_curves](https://github.com/sirkostya009/lissajous_curves_sfml) a small and simple C++ program written with SFML that, well, plots Lissajous Curves.
- [Posters](https://github.com/sirkostya009/spring-project) - a twitter-clone API with JWT auth, posting, following, liking functionality.
- [Panopticon](https://github.com/sirkostya009/the-panopticon). Set of microservices and a UI that allows to add and view books.
- [Shoe-Store](https://github.com/sirkostya009/shoe-store) - similar to Panopticon stack but frontend is written in React now. And you can browse books instead.
