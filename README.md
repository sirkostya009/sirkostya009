# Wassup, my name is Constantine

#### A tech freak. A funny fella. A full stack dev.

### I'm currently working on/studying:
- [REDACTED]-shop, an e-commerce solution for a pal.

### My pride and joy:
- [go-novapost](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sirkostya009/go-novapost) - a library-wrapper for Nova Post API written in Golang.
- [job-scraper](https://github.com/sirkostya009/job-scraper-bot) is a Telegram bot that fixes Djinni's bot and also allows to monitor Dou as well.
- [c-edit](https://github.com/sirkostya009/c-edit) - a very simple C/C++ code editor targeted at beginners.
- [Posters](https://github.com/sirkostya009/spring-project) - a twitter-clone API with JWT auth, posting, following, liking functionality.
- [Panopticon](https://github.com/sirkostya009/the-panopticon) - set of microservices and a UI that allows to add and view books.
- [Shoe-Store](https://github.com/sirkostya009/shoe-store) - stack is similar to Panopticon but the frontend part is written in React instead. And the main product is shoes.

### Honorable mentions:
- [Monolith Cloud](https://github.com/r1sque/monolith-cloud) - an invite-only public file storage made in collaboration with [r1sque](https://github.com/r1sque) made with NextJS.
- [Test Tasks](https://github.com/sirkostya009/test-tasks) - collection of test tasks I've had a privilege (yes) to do.
