# Wassup, my name is Constantine

#### A tech freak. A funny fella. A (mostly) backend dev.

### I'm currently working on/studying:
- [REDACTED]-shop, a work in progress e-commerce solution, implemented with technology such as Golang, [Templ](https://github.com/a-h/templ), [HTMX](https://htmx.org/).

### My pride and joy:
- [tinymux](https://github.com/sirkostya009/tinymux) - a thin extension layer for Golang's http.ServeMux that adds some extra features.
- [job-scraper](https://github.com/sirkostya009/job-scraper-bot) is a Telegram bot that fixes Djinni's bot and also allows to monitor Dou as well.
- [go-novapost](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/sirkostya009/go-novapost) - a library-wrapper for Nova Post API written in Golang.
- [ai-cheats](https://github.com/sirkostya009/ai-cheats) a way to cheat on my uni's online tests. Currently abandoned because OpenAI models are rather stupid and expensive (nah I'm just broke).
- [lissajouse_curves](https://github.com/sirkostya009/lissajous_curves_sfml) a small and simple C++ program written with SFML that, well, plots Lissajous Curves.
- [Posters](https://github.com/sirkostya009/spring-project) - a twitter-clone API with JWT auth, posting, following, liking functionality.
- [Panopticon](https://github.com/sirkostya009/the-panopticon). Set of microservices and a UI that allows to add and view books.
- [Shoe-Store](https://github.com/sirkostya009/shoe-store) - stack is similar to Panopticon but the frontend part is written in React now. And you browse shoes instead.

### Honorable mentions:
- [Monolith Cloud](https://github.com/r1sque/monolith-cloud) - an invite-only public file storage made in collaboration with [r1sque](https://github.com/r1sque).
